# 📜 Transformers on Timeless Texts

_As the name suggests, I've used different transformers and ML models on one of the greatest texts ever written.  
Must do more, but being the procrastinator I am, I don't think I will._

## 🧠 About This Project

Welcome to a beautiful mess of machine learning experiments where I dared to throw modern AI at classical literature.  
This repo is both a playground and a quiet rebellion against productivity.

What happens when you combine the poetic genius of the past with the predictive power of the present?  
You get... this. A strange, chaotic, possibly insightful, maybe even pointless, but definitely *interesting* adventure.

## 🛠️ What’s Inside

- Transformers 🤖 (the NLP kind, not the Michael Bay kind)
- Preprocessing magic ✨
- Sentiment analysis, text generation, embeddings, and other buzzwords
- Results that make you go "huh"

## 🧪 Models Used

- BERT, GPT, and their extended family
- Custom-trained classifiers
- Embedding visualizations (because colors make everything cooler)

## 📚 Text Source

Only one of the **greatest** texts ever written. You’ll know it when you see it.  
(Or check the `data/` folder, cheater.)

## ❓ Why

Because literature + machine learning = endless rabbit hole.  
Also, I was bored.

## 💤 Future Plans

- Do more things.
- Write proper documentation.
- Actually finish something.

But let’s be honest, I’ll probably just open this repo once in a while, stare at it lovingly, and close it again.

## 🤷‍♀️ Contributions

Fork it, break it, improve it, meme it.  
PRs welcome, unless you're a bot. Or maybe even if you are.
